In the Byers residence, Will, Mike, and Jonathan are informed by the agents of the killings that had been happening in Hawkins. As a safety precaution, the agents refuse to reveal Eleven's location due to other factions of the government who are working to find her; contact may jeopardize her life as well as those of everyone else. Until Eleven's training is finished, agents Harmon and Wallace are assigned to take care of the boys. This information overwhelms and infuriates them but the agents assure them they are friends of Sam Owens. Mike receives El's letter from one of the agents in which she proclaims that she will become a superhero again.

In Hawkins High School, Nancy and Robin eventually arrive and join Dustin and Steve. Max informs the others that she saw a vision of the grandfather clock while her body was in an trance-like state, similar to that of Chrissy's in her final moments of life, per Eddie's words. Max further elaborates that both Fred and Chrissy died less than twenty-four hours after their first hallucinations and hypothesizes that she will die the next day after seeing the grandfather clock. The group later meets Lucas, who learns of Max's impending fate while informing Dustin of Jason's intention to capture him for information on Eddie's whereabouts.
