During the events in The Battle of Starcourt, Joyce Byers activates the destruction of the The Key with Jim Hopper's nod of approval. While it's destroying, Hopper flees to the other side of the platform and is heavily injured upon being blasted away by the shockwave. He is eventually found by the surviving Russian soldiers and they take the chief of police captive. Afterwards, Hopper is relentlessly tortured to discover any valuable information. Impressed at his endurance and strength, Hopper is taken to Kamchatka where he is held prisoner and forced to do labor work. There, he is informed by the wardens that any attempts of running away will result in severe punishment.
