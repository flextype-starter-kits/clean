In their residence in Ruth, Nevada, Sam Owens and his wife Cathy are visited by US Colonel Jack Sullivan who gives them autopsy photos of Chrissy Cunningham's corpse and asks for Owen's opinion on what could have caused the death of the girl. The Colonel states that every incident that has happened in Hawkins can be traced back to Eleven, and suggests that she has gone rogue and killed the girl through remote assassination. He points out how Chrissy's body is similar to that of Connie Frazier's corpse. Owen denies this hypothesis, but Sullivan suggests that Eleven is still alive and has been receiving help from the inside, and suspects the mole is Owens himself. After Owens refuses to provide information related to Eleven, Sullivan orders the men to raid his house in search of valuable information and leaves once they have found what they needed. Sensing impending danger, Owens begins to look for El.
